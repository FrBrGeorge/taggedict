Tagged dict
===========

Tags-aware dictionary. Dictionary that uses frozenset of tags as actual key and allows indexing by subset or individual tag. All standard dict operations inherited from `dict`, but indexing by slice allows some set operations and returns an iterator.

**TODO** more documentation.
